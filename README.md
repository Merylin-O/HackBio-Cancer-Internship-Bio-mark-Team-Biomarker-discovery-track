The paper analyzed 230 cases, integrating data from mRNA, miRNA, DNA sequencing, copy number, methylation, and proteomic analyses. It examined tumor and normal samples from patients with various histologic types, most of whom had a history of smoking. Molecular estimates of tumor cellularity provided detailed clinical and molecular insights. Whole-exome sequencing revealed an average mutation rate of 8.87 mutations per megabase, with significant mutations in genes like TP53, KRAS, and EGFR. Distinct mutation patterns were observed between smokers and non-smokers, and focal gene amplifications and deletions were identified, enhancing the understanding of somatic alterations in the disease. The study also identified abnormal RNA transcripts, often caused by gene fusions and splice site mutations. Key drivers of oncogenesis included MET exon 14 skipping and U2AF1 S34F-associated splicing events, offering insights into RNA processing mechanisms contributing to tumor development [(Collisson et al., 2014)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?iLmsie).

The study identified 18 genes with significant mutations, with TP53 and KRAS being the most frequently mutated. Tumor suppressor genes such as STK11 and KEAP1 were also frequently mutated, particularly in cancer cells with high transversion rates linked to smoking history. Additionally, MET and ERBB2 gene amplifications, as well as novel mutations in NF1 and RIT1, were identified as significant driver events in oncogene-negative lung adenocarcinomas, enhancing the understanding of RTK/RAS/RAF pathway activation. The study found that 62% of the tumors contained activating mutations in known oncogenes, which increased to 76% when the novel mutations were included. Significant splicing alterations, such as exon 14 skipping in MET mRNA, were linked to mutations like U2AF1 S34F, leading to aberrant RNA transcript synthesis and tumor development. Key signaling pathways were activated in 76% of cases through the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway, 25% through the PI(3)K-mTOR pathway, and 63% had p53 pathway alterations. However, genomic alterations did not always align with protein-level pathway activation, indicating additional mechanisms in tumorigenesis [(Collisson et al., 2014)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?tlYa80).

The study suggested a new nomenclature for different types of lung adenocarcinoma, linking transcriptional profiles with histopathological and mutational classifications: Terminal Respiratory Unit (TRU), Proximal-Inflammatory (PI), and Proximal-Proliferative (PP). The PP subtype exhibited a higher frequency of KRAS mutations. Additionally, significant heterogeneity was noted, with different tumor clusters identified based on patterns of DNA methylation and chromatin states, particularly in tumors with a CIMP-H phenotype showing gene hypermethylation in WNT pathway genes [(Collisson et al., 2014)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?gHrJwH).
